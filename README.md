# 🌪️ Michael Julius | Collaborative Fidelity

I am building tools to bridge the gap between clinical IEP data and parental advocacy. 
My mission is to ensure that "Fidelity" in education is measured by student outcomes, 
not just legal paperwork.

### 🚀 Flagship Project: The Fidelity-Check
A logic-driven auditor that cross-references IEP PDFs with the **Word Twister** dictionary 
to identify service gaps, data disconnects, and alignment with student career goals.

- **Status:** MVP (Live Performance Ready)
- **Tech:** Python, Pandas, NLP Logic
- **Goal:** Empowering 14.5 million parents in the US special education system.


# 🌪️ Fidelity-Check: Collaborative Fidelity Auditor (MVP)

> **"Bridging the gap between school-system compliance and student-centered outcomes."**

## 📖 Project Vision
In the current Special Education landscape, "Fidelity" is often treated as a legal checkbox. The **Fidelity-Check** reclaims that word for parents. It is a logic-driven auditor designed to ensure that the promises made in an Individualized Education Program (IEP) align with the student's actual classroom performance and future career goals.

## 🚀 Key Features
This MVP demonstrates three core capabilities of the Collaborative Fidelity framework:

1.  **The Jargon Twist:** Automatically scans the IEP for clinical terminology (e.g., PLAAFP, LRE, SDI) and provides "Collaborative Translations" to empower parent advocacy.
2.  **Fidelity Gap Analysis:** A numerical audit that cross-references academic grades against IEP goals. 
    * *Example:* Identifying why a student has a **72% accuracy goal** while currently **failing the class with a 56%**.
3.  **Strategic Goal Alignment:** Ensures "Transition Plans" are not just filler. It audits whether current placements (like the ILC) support high-stakes future goals (like Military Enlistment or Security careers).

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
The engine is built on a "Logic Bridge" architecture:
- **Ingestion:** Extracts raw data from IEP PDFs.
- **Cross-Referencing:** Matches document strings against the `Word_Twister` dictionary.
- **Flagging:** Triggers "Red Flags" when data points contradict student needs.



## 📦 Getting Started
To run the Fidelity Audit simulation:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure dependencies are installed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the engine: `python src/engine.py`.

## 🔒 Data Fidelity & Privacy
This project adheres to strict **Data Fidelity** principles. To ensure FERPA and HIPAA compliance, no PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or raw IEP documents are stored in this public repository. The engine is designed to run in secure, local environments.
