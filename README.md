# 🌪️ Michael Julius | Collaborative Fidelity

I am building tools to bridge the gap between clinical IEP data and parental advocacy. 
My mission is to ensure that "Fidelity" in education is measured by student outcomes, 
not just legal paperwork.

### 🚀 Flagship Project: The Fidelity-Check
A logic-driven auditor that cross-references IEP PDFs with the **Word Twister** dictionary 
to identify service gaps, data disconnects, and alignment with student career goals.

- **Status:** MVP (Live Performance Ready)
- **Tech:** Python, Pandas, NLP Logic
- **Goal:** Empowering 14.5 million parents in the US special education system.
